### General SO steps
Run first the initial provisioning with the vagrant machine started

`$> vagrant provision`

Maybe you need regenerate your vagrant keys with:

```
$> cd tools
$> ssh-keygen -t rsa
$>   [ enter vagrant ]
$>   [ password empty ]
```

### SSH access
Default credentials for SSH access are `vagrant` as user and `vagrant` as password.

In order to allow unatended SSH access for vagrant scripts, you need to set up the Vagrantfile to use an specific ssh key.

1. Modify Vagrantfile to use a key stored in a file including the following line

`config.ssh.private_key_path = "tools/vagrant"`

2. If you don't have one, create your key own key pair with `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
Copy them to the tools directory with the names `vagrant` and `vagrant.pub`.
3. Install them in the machine (run it first, with `vagrant up`)

`$> ssh-copy-id -i tools/vagrant.pub vagrant@localhost -p 2222`

Now you should have unatended access via ssh. To test it, run `vagrant ssh`. If you have any problems, check your access with 

`$> ssh -i tools/vagrant vagrant@localhost -p 2222`
